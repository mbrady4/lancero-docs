# Terminology
On this page you can find some key terminology used throughout Lancero.

## Leads
A lead is the term used for the people you add to your Lancero instance. This term comes from the world of sales where a lead is a person/user that may turn into a paying customer.
A lead can be on the waitlist or not, have claimed a code or not. The state of a lead does not change the way we call it.

## Codes
A code is unique and can be generated on-demand. They are used to give access to your leads. You can generate a code and send it to your lead for them to claim or attach it to them. A code has various parameters you can use to limit access to it. <br/>
These parameters include:
- allowedClaims: The amount of times a code may be claimed
- validFrom: When a code starts to be valid
- validUntil: When a code expires

## Claim
A claim is the combination of a lead and a code. If you wish to use to Lancero to check if a user is allowed on your application, then a claim is what you want to verify.

### Claim Token
Everytime someone claims a code on Lancero we generate a unique token which is valid for 60 seconds. This code can be exchanged for the lead and code data using the secret key you find in your <a href={"https://dashboard.lancero.app/settings/project"}>project settings</a>
