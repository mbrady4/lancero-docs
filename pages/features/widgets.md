# Lancero Widgets
If you already have your own site and want to quickly add Lancero to it, you can do that with Lancero Widgets. These short code fragments integrate right in your Webflow, Wix or Wordpress site and require minimal coding.

## How it works
You can find the code-snippets for Lancero Widgets in <a href={'https://dashboard.lancero.app'}>your dashboard</a> or in their <a href={'https://github.com/joinlancero/widgets'}>GitHub repository</a>. You can copy-paste them straight in your website. Just make sure you replace the public-key placeholder with your own public key. You can find it in the <a href={'https://dashboard.lancero.app/settings/project'}>project settings</a>.
