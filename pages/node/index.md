# Using Lancero with Node.js
When interacting with Lancero in Node.js there are two options.

- [The Official Node.js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lancero/node)
- Manual calls to our API

## Installing the Node.js library
You can install the library using your favourite package manager.

```shell
npm i @lancero/node

yarn add @lancero/node
```

## Using the Node.js library
Any action you wish to perform needs to happen through a Lancero client.


<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You will need your API key for this, find it in the [project settings](https://dashboard.lancero.app/settings/project)
</Callout>

```ts
import Lancero from '@lancero/node'

const lancero = new Lancero("API key");
```

## TypeScript support
The Node.js library is written in TypeScript and thus has built-in, complete support for TypeScript.
